# Architecture Ideas
 * AN UPGRADE WILL JUST BE A COST AND A LIST OF BEHAVIORS AND ACTIONS
 * ACTIONS ARE THINGS THAT ARE TRIGGERED I.E. EXPLOSIONS, SPAWNING, ETC
 * BEHAVIORS ARE THINGS THAT CONSTANTLY MODIFY BEHAVIOR, I.E. SPEED, DIRECTION, ETC
   * BEHAVIORS MAY TRIGGER ACTIONS
## upgrade ideas
 * exploding bullets -> on hit
 * poison/burn/dot -> on hit
 * bullet fractures into more bullets -> on hit
 * BIG bullet size -> on spawn
 * slow effect -> on hit
 * critical hits -> on hit
 * GMP/LMP -> on spawn
 * heat seeking -> while traveling
 * piercing shot -> on hit
 * double shot -> on spawn
 * spiral shot -> while traveling
